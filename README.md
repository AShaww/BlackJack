# BlackJack

# Welcome to BlackJack, a console BlackJack Card game (first to 21).

The standard 52-card pack is used, this rendition of BlackJack will use a single deck of cards.

# OBJECT OF THE GAME
Each participant attempts to beat the dealer by getting a count as close to 21 as possible, without going over 21.

# CARD VALUES/SCORING
It is up to each individual player if an ace is worth 1 or 11. Face cards are 10 and any other card is its pip value.

# NUMBER OF PLAYERS?
There is currently a dealer and a player, You.

# THE DEALER'S PLAY
When the dealer has served every player, the dealers face-down card is turned up.
If the total is 17 or more, it must stand. If the total is 16 or under, they must take a card.
The dealer must continue to take cards until the total is 17 or more, at which point the dealer must stand.

# NATURAL BLACKJACK
If a player's first two cards are an ace and a "ten-card" (a picture card or 10), giving a count of 21 in two cards, this is a natural or "blackjack."
If the player has a natural and the dealer does not, the dealer immediately LOSES.
